# Number-Classification-PyTorch

A short and simple project that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in PyTorch to classify hand-drawn digits (0â€“9) from a canvas input.

## Description

This project implements a lightweight 2D CNN to recognize digits drawn by the user in a browser-based canvas. It is trained on the MNIST dataset and can predict a digit based on real-time input from the canvas. The drawing is processed, resized to 28x28 grayscale, and passed to the trained model for inference.

The model is saved as "model.pth"

## Features

- Interactive drawing canvas
